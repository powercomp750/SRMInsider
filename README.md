# DTM Campus Navigator

This is a working prototype/solution for solving campus navigation and other issues. Project was created for Design Thinking &amp; Methology (DTM) subject.


## Story behind project...

Basically we were a team of 6 members and was assigned to create something working prototype solution for our problem statement in our college we face.

We chose campus navigation since new students aka freshers don't know anything about college venues like campus buildings, hostels, offices.

This project is designed to assist them and provide an effortless navigation experience. In my team, lead members assigned me for same thing to design that solution for problem. Basically this subject is project based so internal marks are evaluted by assignements, activites and performance of project which is created.

You can personally dm me for further enquires regarding team and project design. For now let's proceed with prototype...

  ```
  
* Launch ```main.html``` to get started.
